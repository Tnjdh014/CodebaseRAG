# CodebaseRAG
This repository demonstrates an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow for querying codebases. The project enables users to understand specific functionalities (e.g., JavaScript parser usage) in a codebase by embedding query and file content, storing them in a Pinecone vector store, and retrieving context for LLM-based responses.
